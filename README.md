## What is TODAP

TODAP is a simple todo-list application created in order to get to know the basics of [React.js](https://react.dev/) aswell as different useful libraries like [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), [ReactQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) or the [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/).
